# nimbly-testbuild

This is a test build for Nimbly to demonstrate the use of an API with a REACT app. The emphasis of this is to connect with one of their three api choices and present a front end example. I chose the Newton API that performs simplifcations and when possible solves equations for the user. The text idea is to be simple and I tried to stick with a fading theme for the css to keep it simple and pleasing to the eye.
